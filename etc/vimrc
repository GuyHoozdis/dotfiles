" VIM IDE Configuration
"
"   http://200ok.ch/posts/vim-as-python-ide.html
"
" Notes:
" - The global configuration flags, form MiniBufExpl, cited by the article are
"   all obsolete.  The only thing that needs to be added is a key mapping.
" - If you like the TagList + CTags functionality, then you should add the
"   installation command `brew install ctags-exuberant` to the proper script.
" - To prevent rendering corruption, in the tag list window, after a tag is
"   selected the `TList_Inc_Winwidth` option is set to zero.
" - TagList is taking a lot of configuration to start working like I expect. I
"   think it is in a basic usable state right now, but you probably still need
"   to go over the "Commands" section of the documentation and possibly tweak
"   a few more of the plugin settings.
" - The article describes using VIM's `omnifunc` to gain code completion. That
"   has never worked very well for me.  I'm going to give `jedi-vim` a try
"   again.
"
" Update:
" - I've come to enjoy Mini Buff Explorer.
" - I don't use TagList.  I'm removing any related config for it.
" - I discovered `pymode` recently and have been very happy with the
"   functionality and features it offers, but it might be a dying
"   project.
